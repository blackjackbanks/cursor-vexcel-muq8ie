## WHY - Vision & Purpose

### Purpose & Users

**Problem:** Traditional spreadsheet users often struggle with writing advanced formulas, understanding large data sets, and managing complex data transformations.

**Solution:** An AI-enhanced Excel application that seamlessly integrates a contextual AI assistant to provide auto-completion for formulas, explain complex cell logic, clean data, and recommend optimizations.

**Primary Users:**

- Financial analysts

- Data scientists

- Business users working with large datasets

- Non-technical users seeking assistance with formulas and insights

**Why They’ll Use It:**

- To reduce manual errors and increase productivity by leveraging contextual AI completions

- Gain real-time insights and recommendations

- Easily handle complex formulas without prior technical expertise

----------

## WHAT - Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**System must:**

- Provide AI-powered formula auto-completions in real-time

- Enable natural language queries for generating formulas, analyzing data, and cleaning tables

- Summarize spreadsheet contents and suggest optimizations (e.g., removing duplicates, filling missing data)

- Offer interactive explanations of complex formulas and debugging recommendations

- Support version tracking and the ability to revert AI-driven changes

- Integrate with external data sources to fetch and analyze data (e.g., APIs or databases)

**User Capabilities:**

- Users must be able to:

  - Request AI-generated formulas by typing natural language queries

  - Correct AI-generated suggestions before applying them

  - Automatically clean and organize data tables

  - Track changes made by the AI assistant

  - Integrate external data into their spreadsheets using simple commands

----------

## HOW - Planning & Implementation

### Technical Implementation

**Required Stack Components:**

- Frontend: Excel Add-In using Office.js API

- Backend: AI completion service via OpenAI API (or fine-tuned model)

- Integrations: Connectors for data APIs and cloud storage

- Infrastructure: Hosted backend to handle AI requests and process data

**System Requirements:**

- **Performance:** Ensure AI responses within 1-2 seconds for formula suggestions

- **Security:** Encryption for user data and formula processing

- **Scalability:** Handle concurrent requests from thousands of users

- **Reliability:** Maintain 99.9% uptime

----------

### User Experience

**Key User Flows:**

1. **AI Formula Completion**

   - **Entry Point:** User begins typing a formula or selects “AI Assist”

   - **Steps:** Partial formula → AI suggestion → User confirms or adjusts → Apply

   - **Success:** Correct formula inserted into cell

   - **Alternative Flow:** Manual correction by user if AI-generated formula is incorrect

2. **Natural Language Query**

   - **Entry Point:** User opens AI chat sidebar

   - **Steps:** Type query (e.g., “Sum sales by region”) → Receive formula suggestion → Apply

   - **Success:** Formula is inserted with explanation

   - **Alternative Flow:** User refines or rephrases the query

3. **Data Cleaning**

   - **Entry Point:** User selects a data range and chooses “Clean Data”

   - **Steps:** AI scans for inconsistencies → Suggests corrections → User confirms changes

   - **Success:** Clean and optimized data

4. **Formula Explanation**

   - **Entry Point:** User hovers over or selects a formula

   - **Steps:** AI breaks down components → Highlights errors or inefficiencies → Suggests improvements

   - **Success:** User gains understanding and can correct errors

----------

### Business Requirements

**Access & Authentication:**

- User login with Microsoft account

- Role-based access for data permissions

**Business Rules:**

- Data processed by AI must not leave the user’s local environment unless explicitly allowed

- AI suggestions must log all changes for tracking and rollback

- Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR)

----------
