# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the AI-enhanced Excel Add-in project, including vulnerability reporting procedures, security measures, and compliance requirements.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | End of Support |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: | TBD           |

Only Excel 2019 and later versions are supported with this add-in.

## Authentication and Authorization

### OAuth 2.0 + JWT Implementation

- Microsoft Identity integration using MSAL (v2.1.0)
- JWT tokens with enhanced security features:
  - Token fingerprinting
  - Device-based validation
  - Refresh token rotation
  - Token family tracking
  - Comprehensive session management

### Token Security Measures

- Access tokens expire after 1 hour
- Refresh tokens expire after 7 days
- Token blacklisting using Redis
- Device fingerprinting for token validation
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts:
  - 3 failed attempts trigger a 5-minute lockout
  - IP-based tracking
  - Device-based validation

## Data Protection

### Encryption Standards

| Data State | Method | Key Management |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| In Transit | TLS 1.3 | Azure Key Vault |
| At Rest | AES-256 | Azure Key Vault |
| In Memory | Secure string handling | Runtime encryption |
| Database | Transparent Data Encryption | Azure SQL TDE |

### Data Classification

1. Public
   - No encryption required
   - Publicly available information

2. Internal
   - Standard encryption (AES-256)
   - General business data

3. Confidential
   - Enhanced encryption (AES-256 + Field Level)
   - Customer data
   - Formula logic

4. Restricted
   - Maximum security (AES-256 + Field Level + MFA)
   - Authentication credentials
   - Encryption keys

## Access Control

### Rate Limiting

| Endpoint | Rate Limit |
|----------|------------|
| /api/v1/formula/suggest | 100 requests/minute |
| /api/v1/data/clean | 20 requests/minute |
| /api/v1/version/{id} | 200 requests/minute |
| /api/v1/changes/batch | 50 requests/minute |

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Formula Generation | Data Cleaning | Version History | Admin Functions |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Basic User | Read/Write | Read/Write | Read Only | None |
| Power User | Read/Write | Read/Write | Read/Write | None |
| Admin | Read/Write | Read/Write | Read/Write | Full Access |
| Auditor | Read Only | Read Only | Read Only | Read Only |

## Compliance Requirements

### GDPR Compliance
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Right to erasure implementation
- Data portability support
- Quarterly compliance audits

### SOC 2 Compliance

   - Potential impact assessment
   - Technical details

2. Expected Response Times:
   - Initial response: 24 hours
   - Status update: 72 hours
   - Resolution timeline: Based on severity

### Bug Bounty Program

| Severity | Reward Range |
|----------|--------------|
| Critical | $5,000 - $10,000 |
| High | $2,000 - $4,999 |
| Medium | $500 - $1,999 |
| Low | $100 - $499 |

## Security Response

### Incident Response Protocol

1. Detection & Analysis
   - Automated monitoring
   - User reports
   - Security scans

2. Containment
   - Immediate threat isolation
   - Affected system quarantine
   - Token revocation if necessary

3. Eradication & Recovery
   - Vulnerability patching
   - System restoration
   - Security measure updates

4. Post-Incident
   - Root cause analysis
   - Security measure updates
   - Documentation updates

### Security Update Management

| Component | Update Frequency | Validation Process |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| OS Dependencies | Monthly | Automated testing |
| NPM Packages | Weekly | Security scan + Tests |
